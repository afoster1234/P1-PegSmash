## Project Report
Coding this project has been the most enjoyable yet. This is also the most polished game I have created to date. Granted the premise is simple, but the more I learn to use Godot Engine the more I am able to do with it. I now have a better understanding of how the pieces all fit together and playing with the sounds is a lot of fun. Completing this assignment has made me think a lot about just how endless the possibilities are with game programming. Creativity is something that I pride myself on having and I think this game shows that. The most challenging thing I think this time around was when deciding how I wanted my inventory system to work and how I instanced the projectile. This was by far the most challenging but at the same time, very rewarding when I finally figured it out. I can not wait for Iteration 3!
