Austin Foster | https://afoster1234.github.io/P1-PegSmash/

## INSTRUCTIONS 

                      TAB: Load Chamber
    LEFT/RIGHT Arrow Keys: Angle Control
       UP/DOWN Arrow Keys: Power Control
                        F: Fires Projectile
            Reload Button: Reloads Magazine to 10

OBJECTIVE: Clear all targets to WIN!
NOTE: Angle Control is locked to only allow shots from zero to ninety degrees. Timing is key!
NOTE: Projectile Path may not be 100% accurate because it is falling when you fire it.

## Project Report

This Iteration I thought was definatly a great learning experience for me because even though you make a "game", it doesnt necessarily mean that it is a complete game. This time around, coding this game has given me a broader scope for the types for things that actually have to be implemented into a game for it to really be considered a finished game. I liked the use of AnimationPlayer as well because even though my implementation was fairy bare bones, I know that the possibilities are only limited by our imagination. This Iteration has taught me a few things about planning ahead and really making sure that you have a very clean coded game and making sure all of the pieces work together efficiently. I can not wait to make another game for Project 2!

- [X] C-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, and the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [X] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, and the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file.
- [X] C-4: The <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game itself.
